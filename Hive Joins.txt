                                                    Hive Joins

JOIN is a clause that is used for combining specific fields from two tables by using values common to each one.
It is used to combine records from two or more tables in the database.

There are different types of joins given as follows:

1. JOIN: JOIN clause is used to combine and retrieve the records from multiple tables. JOIN is same as OUTER JOIN in SQL.
	 A JOIN condition is to be raised using the primary keys and foreign keys of the tables.

Syntax: SELECT col1_tab1, col2_tab1, col1_tab2 FROM table1 JOIN table2 ON condition(col1_tab1 = col1_tab2);

2. LEFT OUTER JOIN: The HiveQL LEFT OUTER JOIN returns all the rows from the left table, even if there are no matches in
	 the right table. This means, if the ON clause matches 0 (zero) records in the right table, the JOIN still returns
	 a row in the result, but with NULL in each column from the right table.

	 A LEFT JOIN returns all the values from the left table, plus the matched values from the right table, or NULL in
	 case of no matching JOIN predicate.

Syntax: SELECT col1_tab1, col2_tab1, col1_tab2 FROM table1 LEFT OUTER JOIN table2 ON condition(col1_tab1 = col1_tab2);

3. RIGHT OUTER JOIN: The HiveQL RIGHT OUTER JOIN returns all the rows from the right table, even if there are no matches in
	 the left table. If the ON clause matches 0 (zero) records in the left table, the JOIN still returns a row in the
	 result, but with NULL in each column from the left table.

	 A RIGHT JOIN returns all the values from the right table, plus the matched values from the left table, or NULL in 
	 Case of no matching join predicate.

Syntax: SELECT col1_tab1, col2_tab1, col1_tab2 FROM table1 RIGHT OUTER JOIN table2 ON condition(col1_tab1 = col1_tab2);

4. FULL OUTER JOIN: The HiveQL FULL OUTER JOIN combines the records of both the left and the right outer tables that fulfil
	 the JOIN condition. The joined table contains either all the records from both the tables, or fills in NULL values
	 for missing matches on either side.

Syntax: SELECT col1_tab1, col2_tab1, col1_tab2 FROM table1 FULL OUTER JOIN table2 ON condition(col1_tab1 = col1_tab2);
